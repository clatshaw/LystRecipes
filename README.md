Lyst: Recipes Website

Website Overview (taken from the Project Management Plan doc):
The Lyst: Recipes project is a system where users may enter a list of ingredients that they have available and will be given a list of recipes they could make with said ingredients. The user will select from abridged lists of ingredients to avoid validating user entry, and will be subject to several criteria such as food groups (meat, grain, vegetable, fruit, dairy), meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, appetizer, dessert), and required preparation time.


The Lyst: Recipes system is built on the concept of being a social network in that its content is heavily user-based. Recipes will initially be sourced by developers to ensure trusted content, but will eventually be more self-regulating by its users as the consumer base grows. This is done by allowing users to submit their own recipes as well as comment and rate existing ones. Recipes entered by developers from known sources (such as Food Network, allrecipes.com, or McCormick) will be marked as trusted, and user submissions will require a certain number of positive ratings to be marked as trusted in order to ensure a certain level of quality.
